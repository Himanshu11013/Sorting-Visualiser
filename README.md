# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project visualizes two sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Merge Sort, using SFML graphics in C++. It allows users to interactively see how these algorithms sort a set of randomized numbers.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need SFML installed on your system. If you haven't installed SFML yet, you can follow the instructions on [SFML Installation Guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php).

## Prerequisites

- SFML 2.5.1 or later
- C++ compiler that supports C++11

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository
   
## Usage
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to choose a sorting algorithm (1 for Bubble Sort, 2 for Merge Sort).

The visualization window will open, showing a randomized set of numbers represented as vertical lines.

Watch as the chosen sorting algorithm visually sorts the lines.

Features
1. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
Controls
Close the window to terminate the program.
